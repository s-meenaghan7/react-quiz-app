# Quiz App in React

A simple quiz app made using the React JavaScript library.

The idea behind this project was to get more comfortable with React. After deciding to pick up on the library and learn how to use it to build frontends, I have found myself having a lot of fun with it.

This is a small quiz application that allows the user to complete a quiz. The program keeps track of the user's score as they complete the quiz. The implementation makes adding or removing questions and/or answers very easy.

*TODO:*
- *Modularize the code into multiple components*
- *Give it some style*
